### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my page on [Microsoft's GitHub](https://www.whoprofits.org/companies/company/7371?microsoft)

I am a graduate student at the University of Michigan and a former research assistant for the [LIT Group 🔥](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu).

While I don't actively maintain this account besides a few personal projects, most of my repositories have to be kept private/archived for academic integrity 🤠
